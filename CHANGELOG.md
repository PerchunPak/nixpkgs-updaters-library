## Version 1.0.2

- Added a centralized place to define executables, so it is easier to patch it from Nix ([`db1f608e`](https://github.com/PerchunPak/nixpkgs-updaters-library/commit/db1f608e725d45f35e0082b666fbdb4af96ceeb6))

## Version 1.0.1

- Switched building system to hatchling, because setuptools didn't look for code recursively ([`8691eb50`](https://github.com/PerchunPak/nixpkgs-updaters-library/commit/8691eb50dc2dd0a6087fb5a26717bd676c87295c))
