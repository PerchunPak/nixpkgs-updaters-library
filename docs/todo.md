# TODO

- [x] Sourcehut does not support fetching the latest revision???
- [x] Test fetching specific branch
- [x] `nix-prefetch-url` should have `unpack` default to False
- [x] `nix-prefetch-git` has `--quiet`, which we should always provide
- [ ] Check that IDs are equal
- [ ] Cache invalidation
- [ ] progress bar
- [ ] Duplicate plugins?
- [ ] Some abstraction for implementing redirects & deprecations
